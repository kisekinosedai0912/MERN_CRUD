🛠️ MERN Stack CRUD Application

This is my first project built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).
It’s a basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application that demonstrates how to build a full-stack app with proper backend and frontend integration.

The goal of this project is to:

✅ Understand how to connect Node.js/Express to MongoDB using Mongoose

✅ Build RESTful APIs for managing data

✅ Integrate the backend with a React frontend

✅ Practice handling CRUD operations from both the server and client side

✅ Gain hands-on experience with environment setup and package management (using pnpm)

This project serves as my foundation for more advanced MERN applications.
